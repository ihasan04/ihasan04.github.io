Whether it's a passion or just the simple fact of being born a Millennial, in a generation engulfed with gadgets, devices, and apps, tech has always been a part of my life. The video game phenomenon has taken over my youth without any mercy and forced me to constantly upgrade my pc in the most unnecessary of ways. I was never a console gamer. I always preferred a pc, where I could tinker, take apart, upgrade, basically do whatever I could afford to get my rig up to scratch to game at the highest quality settings hoping to achieve a smooth FPS plateau. Ofcourse, growing up in a large family, in Brooklyn, NY, to hardworking parents, this was virtually impossible.

As I began my college years, I initially decided to major in Graphic Design at the New York Institute of Technology, looking to get into a career of video game development. Luckily my good grades in highschool got me a free ride. Turns out im not an artist and I didn’t really like the courses I was taking. I soon left and joined a local community college in Staten Island and changed majors to Computer Science/Programming. Due to some very poor life decisions I was never able to finish my degree.

Along this story of life, I caught a lucky break and got employed by the College of Staten Island as a Program Assistant for its Technology Incubator, a space dedicated to foster entrepreneurship and building a tech ecosystem in our area. Within my role there, I quickly spotted a need for industry and career related tech programming to supplement the undergrad students, as the general Computer Science degrees were not proving successful in their job searching. Critical elements were missing. This paved the way for a new position as Program Coordinator, where I would be overseeing particular tech workshops, events, and student programming to help our students and the community (including high school level) become better prepared to enter the tech industry.

With that, as I began to introduce our students to different technologies, skills, languages, and opportunities, the flame rekindled within. I constantly kept telling myself, “Why you never did this when you were younger,” and “Oh, this is cool, I want to do this too.” I want to continue my passion for tech and become engulfed once more. This time, not for sheer entertainment, but for an enjoyable life and career, where I would be able to take care of and provide for my family. At this stage in my life, a software engineering program of high caliber, such that of Flatiron, seems to be the best decision for me. I'm excited for the journey.
